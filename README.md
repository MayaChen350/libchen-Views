# libChen-Views

This library contains code I wrote while using **Android Views** at CÉGEP Édouard-Montpetit. I edited it to be included as a library.

It was mostly written to spare me some boilerplate I encountered and was annoyed about.

## Using it
The library should be available through [jitpack](https://jitpack.io/#MayaChen350/libchen-Views).
