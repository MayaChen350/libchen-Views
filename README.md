# libChen-Views

This library contains code I wrote while using **Android Views** at CÉGEP Édouard-Montpetit. I edited it to be included as a library.

It was mostly written to spare me some boilerplate I encountered and was annoyed about.

### Using it

The library should be available through [jitpack](https://jitpack.io/#MayaChen350/libchen-Views).

### Notices

This library is licensed under **MIT**. As long as you respect the license, feel free to fork it and edit it to your needs!  
You can also create a pull request if you really want to, I'm not prohibiting that.
